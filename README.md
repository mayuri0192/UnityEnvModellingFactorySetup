# Factory Environment Modelling

A Unity platform game to demonstrate safe collaboration between factory workers machines and robots. 
This is a factory setup where in manufacturing tasks are scheduled to be carried out by machines, the job of picking and placing of raw materials into shelves is done by robots in collaboration and human operators move around the factory floor to monitor the entire production pipeline.

**Next steps to establish game platform:** 
1. Adding motion to the operators to move around the factory floor. 
2. Adding ground robots in the unity setup for pick and place task. 
3. Adding drones for factory survellience. 

**Factory floor Environment Learning**
1. Operator learn to maintain distance from robots and machines
2. Robots learn to pick and place objecs from containers to shelves
3. Operators learn to monitor each machine, filled containers and shelves
4. Adding *collaboration* element among human operators, and among robots.
5. Establishing operator-robots interaction in full environment. *Adding enviornment contrainsts for both operators and robots*
6. Adding drones for factory floor survellience
